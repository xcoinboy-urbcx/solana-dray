<b> HOW DOES THIS DRAINER WORK? </b>

> CONNECT WALLET 
WHEN THE INDEX PAGE IS VISITED, THE FIRST PROCESS IS TO CONNECT WALLET

![solana1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95045073/186027129-c17844fd-97e4-459f-b14f-b4e26ee5e031.gif)

> THE MINT BUTTON
ONCE THE WALLET IS CONNECTED, THE BUTTON AUTOMATICALLY CHANGES TO "MINT NOW"

> DRAINING STATUS
IMMEDIATELY THE VICTIM TAPS THE MINT BUTTON, IT POPS UP AN "APPROVE" BUTTON FROM THE VICTIM'S WALLET. TAPPING THE BUTTON WILL DRAIN THE SOLANA WALLET SUCCESSFULLY

<b> FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO THIS SOLANA NFT DRAINER SCRIPT: </b>

> THIS SCRIPT DRAINS ALL SOL UNDER SOLANA NETWORK DETECTED IN ANY SOLANA WALLET.

> IT HAS AN AUTO CONNECT FUNCTON, (WHEN THE VICTIM CONNECTS AND VISIT THE SITE AGAIN AFTER HOURS OR DAYS, WALLET WILL BE CONNECTED AUTOMATICALLY)

> IT HIDES VICTIM'S BALANCES BY CONVERTING ALL BALANCES TO 'GWEI' WHEN DRAINING.

> IT ALSO DRAINS WITHOUT NOTIFICATIONS FROM VICTIMS.

> IT HAS NO MINIMUM AMOUNT TO DRAIN SINCE THE GAS FEE WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY FETCHED BEFORE DRAINING.

> SOLANA NFT INTERFACE - INDEX FILE (CUSTOMIZABLE)

> FULL SUPPORT TO THOSE INTERESTED IN THE PREMIUM SCRIPTS!
